        <p class="p1">Discover the architecture and design</p>
        <br> 
        <p>The Burj Khalifa was designed by the Chicago-based architectural firm, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. The building is <br> inspired by the geometry of a desert flower, and it features a Y-shaped floor plan that maximizes views and natural light. <br> The exterior is clad in reflective glass and steel, and it features a series of setbacks that create a spiraling silhouette. <br> The tower is a marvel of modern engineering and a symbol of Dubai's ambition and innovation.</p>
